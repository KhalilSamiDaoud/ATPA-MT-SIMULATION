# APTA-SIM


This (Js / css / html) application simulates Microtransit from trip data at x60 speed (CSV or API input). Information about each trip, vehicle, route, and day is displayed on the UI and each panel can be popped-out to make use of multiple monitors. The UI was styled according to 'Material Design' guidelines. The simulation also includes an interactive booking component which shows the power of IT Curves ERSA / ARB routing engine, and will seamlessly update the simulation in real time when new trips are booked. 

The live booking component will not work unless configured to IT Curves back-end.
